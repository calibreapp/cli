This repository contains [Calibre‚Äôs](https://calibreapp.com/) APIs you can use to fetch and manage your monitoring data. The Command Line Client (CLI) is designed for simple tasks right from your terminal. We recommend using the Node.js API for more complex tasks and automation.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Please note:** Using the APIs requires an active Calibre account (in trial or on a paid plan).

## üì• Installation

To install the latest version globally, run this command:

```bash
npm install -g calibre
```

or save it directly to your project:

```bash
npm install calibre --save
```

The `calibre` package is built to support **all current Node.js LTS releases**.

## üîê Authentication

To authenticate to Calibre and use the APIs, **you will need to create or use an existing API Token**. Learn about the [types of API Tokens and how to create them here](https://calibreapp.com/docs/account-and-billing/manage-api-tokens).

Once you have an API Token, you can [store it locally](https://calibreapp.com/docs/automation/tokens#store-a-token-locally):

```bash
calibre token set <your token>
```

Or alternately, set [`CALIBRE_API_TOKEN` environment variable](https://calibreapp.com/docs/automation/tokens#store-a-token-as-an-environment-variable).

## üí° Features

- **Manage performance with a single command**. Retrieve all speed data and manage the test environment and settings.
- **Run [Single Page Tests](https://calibreapp.com/docs/automation/single-page-tests)**. Create one-off tests privately or share them with your team.
- **Monitor speed across your release process**. Track performance between deploys and mark them on your charts.
- **Use Calibre within CI/CD**. Every command has a `--json` flag for machine-readable output.
- **Script any action**. We export all API methods to the Calibre `npm` package..

## üõ† Usage

To see a full list of available commands, subcommands and options run:

```bash
$ calibre --help
$ calibre <command> --help
```

or [see all commands](CLI_COMMANDS.md) in this repository or [Calibre‚Äôs documentation](https://calibreapp.com/docs/automation/cli-commands).

In Node, you can use the either ES Modules or CommonJS versions accordingly:

```javascript
// ES Modules
import { Site } from 'calibre'
await Site.list()
```

```javascript
// CommonJS
const { Site } = require('calibre')
await Site.list()
```

## üì§ Package exports

In addition to the named default exports shown above, the `calibre` package also exports CLI related metadata, which is used to generate CLI documentation.

### CLI Commands

Each CLI command is a Node module that exports `command`, `describe`, `handler` and `builder`. You can import all CLI commands from `calibre/cli-commands` (see [`src/cli.js`](https://github.com/calibreapp/cli/blob/main/src/cli.js) for reference).

```javascript
import Commands from 'calibre/cli-commands'
```

### CLI Metadata

You can import command metadata (used to generate CLI documentation) from the `calibre/cli-metadata` export:

```javascript
import { getCommandMetaData } from 'calibre/cli-metadata'
console.log(JSON.stringify(getCommandMetaData(), null, 2))
```
